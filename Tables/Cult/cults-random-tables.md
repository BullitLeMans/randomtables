These tables can be used together to create a random cult.

Here's a sample result from the series:

> *The cultists revere a long-dead ancient villain.
Their primary goals are convert all infidels as well as defeating death.
The members are primarily orcs who meet in the cellar of a wealthy merchant's house.
The cult's practices include secretly committing petty evil daily. and every member makes a pilgrimage to underworld holy site.
They are somehow associated with the abstract concept of the solidity of earth.
The cults secret is that through a "curse" the cultists are only able to act towards good.*

>Possible plot hooks include
1. Powerful cleric keeps forgetting previous night and manifesting stigmata.
2. Cultists harassed the wrong person
